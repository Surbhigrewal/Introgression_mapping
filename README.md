# Introgression_mapping

This pipeline identifies and visualises candidate introgressions in wheat and wild relative genomes by analysing genome-wide coverage deviation. It processes raw sequencing data, maps reads to a combined reference, computes normalised coverage profiles, and detects introgressed regions based on characteristic signal shifts.

This pipeline is combined approach based on the [alien_detection](https://github.com/benedictcoombes/alien_detection) pipeline by Coombes et al. (2023)and the [SkimSeq_Method](https://github.com/sandeshsth/SkimSeq_Method) method by Adhikari et al. (2022).

These resources laid the groundwork for coverage-based introgression detection in low-coverage resequencing data.
